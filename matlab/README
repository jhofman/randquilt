randquilt is a hack to generate random quilt patch colors,
necessitated by @amandahofman's latest project.

it lays out an R-by-C grid of multicolored hexagonal patches. each
patch is made of concentric hexagons, and patch colors respect the
following constraints:

  * no two neighboring patches have the same outer patch color
  * no color is repeated within a patch

quilt.m will randomly sample colors subject to these constraints and
produce a pdf (quilt.pdf) and text (quilt.txt) representation of the
quilt.

randquilt is currently coded in matlab, although i'd like to convert
it to python+scipy at some point.
