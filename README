randquilt is a hack to generate random quilt patch colors,
necessitated by @amandahofman's latest project.

it lays out an R-by-C grid of multicolored hexagonal patches. each
patch is made of concentric hexagons, and patch colors respect the
following constraints:

  * no two neighboring patches have the same outer patch color
  * no color is repeated within a patch

randquilt.html will randomly sample colors subject to these
constraints and produce a image and text representation of the quilt.
